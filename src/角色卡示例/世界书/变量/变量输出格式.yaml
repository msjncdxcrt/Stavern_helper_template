    - you must output the update analysis and the actual update commands at once in the end of the next reply
    - the update commands works like the **JSON Patch (RFC 6902)** standard, must be a valid JSON array containing operation objects, but supports the following operations instead:
      - replace: replace the value of existing paths
      - delta: update the value of existing number paths by a delta value
      - insert: insert new items into an object or array
      - remove
    - don't update field names starts with `_` as they are readonly, such as `_变量`
